# RFID-Door-Lock

## Overview

This personal project is a Arduino-based RFID door lock system. It simulates a secure acess system where a servo motor unlocks a "door" wen a valid RFID card is scanned.

## Objectives

- Learn how to implement the MFRC522 RFID reader and servo motors with Arduino
- Practice soldering and use of breadboard
- Create a functional access control mechanism using servo motors.
- Document a personal project

## Features

- Servo motor (SG90) which operates as a lock/unlock mechanism
- RFID authentication using MFRC522
- Card with UID for access control.
- Code using Arduino Libraries

## Tools and Technologies

- **Hardware:**
  - Arduino Uno
  - MFRC522 RFID Module
  - SG90 servo motor
  - RFID card 
  - Wires and breadboard
  - Soldering wire and iron

- **Software:**
